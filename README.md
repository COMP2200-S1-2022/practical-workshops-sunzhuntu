# Practical-Workshops-S1-2022
This repository contains practical notebooks for COMP2200/COMP6200 for Session S1-2022 @ Macquarie University

This repository will contain your practical notebooks for COMP2200/COMP6200 Session S1, 2022. The initial repository has one notebook for the first week. Each week you will add a new notebook and commit your changes as you complete the problems set for you. At the end of the semester you will have this repository as a record of your work. This can then form part of your ongoing portfolio of work.

You can update this README file to personalise your repository.
